        <p> Daniel Saias was born on February 30th 1990 in Kings Landing, Westeros. He learned the Jedi
        Way by reading the sacred texts with Luke Skywalker and was a Jedi Master by age 10. Then he decided
        he wanted to learn magic so he applied to Hogwarts School of Magic where he got a scolarship. He 
        graduated at age 16 and became their Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher right away. After 5 years there, 
        he decided that coding was more important than magic and the Jedi Way so he enrolled at Tufts University.
        After his first year he got an internship at a financier company where he learned a lot about their
        business and how they operate. Then he returned to Tufts and decided that his next internship was going
        to be more code-related so he got an internship at a wealth management company where he is writing code
        to help them optimize their work. </p>
