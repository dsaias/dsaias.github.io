COMP 20 (online)
Lab 4

1. To my knowledge, every aspect of the work has been correctly implemented. I checked that the websites work properly and they meet the lab requirements. I succesfully put all my files in my github special repo, I used Git constantly with meaningful messages, I wrote this README file, I used at least 5 rules in my one (and only) CSS file, and my files are named exactly index.html, resume.html, and bio.html. 

2. I did this lab alone, as specified on the lab 4 guide page. 

3. It took me approximately 4 hours to complete this lab. 

4. This is a README.md file
